# CTF Web Project

Hey there! My name is Sihab, and this is my first web CTF project. I only know how to use native PHP, so please be kind, haha! ðŸ¤£

I hope you enjoy exploring this project. It's my humble attempt at creating a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge, and I'm really excited to share it with you. While it may not be perfect, I put in a lot of effort, and I hope it provides a fun experience for you. Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements if you like.

### Features:
- Native PHP-based web application
- Various challenges to test your skills
- Simple and straightforward approach

Please don't hesitate to leave feedback or open issues if you find anything. Thanks for checking out my project!

Good luck and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
